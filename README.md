Additionally, make sure Google Cloud network settings have been
changed to allow the connection between the client, server, and database.

directory where the client is located. Use the command `python .\client.py`. 
As prompted, enter the IP address and port number of the server. Review the
query choices once corrected. Enter a number 1 through 3 for any query or 4
to Cancel and disconnect. Send as many queries as necesssary.
